# Shepard Rodgers Personal Website

I built this site to share the things that I am working on and passionate about, across my education, career, and hobbies.

You can explore my site at [shepardrodgers.github.io](https://shepardrodgers.github.io/).

For more information on running this site locally or using the GitHub Pages template for yourself, you can visit [academicpages.github.io](https://academicpages.github.io/).

Enjoy!

*This site was built using Jekyll & AcademicPages, a fork of Minimal Mistakes.*
