This project was organized through [JumboCode](https://jumbocode.org/), a student-run digital agency at Tufts that provides custom and high-quality software to nonprofits through year-long pro bono projects. To guide our work on this project, my team collaborated with [Theatre@First](https://www.theatreatfirst.org/), an all-volunteer community theatre in Somerville, MA. 

My experience working on this project was one of unfamiliar technologies, workflows, and expectations, as I was only beginning my computing journey. These novelties taught me a lot about how to work effectively in a diverse team, build a complicated project from the ground up, and negotiate needs with an external client. Through weekly sprints, regular workshops, and occasional reviews, we were able to gradually build and deliver a polished inventory system that exceeded the expectations of Theater@First, allowing them to better organize their overwhelming stock of costumes, props, and other miscellaneous items. 

In the final version, users are able to search for items by name, status, or tag. Various local theatre groups can use this inventory resource to rent out available items and communicate with one another. I was personally responsible for building an accessible and elegant front end alongside API endpoints to connect our database to our app.
