Hi! My name is Shepard and I'm a Junior at Tufts University working at the intersection of computational technology and societal impact. My academic and professional interests are centered around:
1. **Public Interest Technology (PIT)**: Building technology in a responsible and equitable way, while centering impacted communities, drawing from many disciplines, and placing public benefit before profit incentives.
2. **AI Safety and Alignment**: Researching and building safeguards to ensure the responsible development of robust artificial intelligence systems that promote trust, value alignment, and oversight mechanisms.
