Hey there, my name is Shepard and I'm a Junior at Tufts University studying Computer Science and [STS (Science, Technology, and Society)](https://admissions.tufts.edu/blogs/jumbo-talk/post/what-s-sts/). I work at the intersection of computational technology and societal impact,  with my academic and professional interests centered around:
1. **AI Safety and Alignment**: Researching frontier AI models to ensure the responsible development of these systems while promoting trust, value alignment, and oversight mechanisms. [Here's why it matters.](https://safe.ai/ai-risk)
2. **Public Interest Technology (PIT)**: Building technology in a responsible and equitable way, while centering impacted communities, drawing from many disciplines, and placing public benefit before profit incentives.
2. **AI Safety and Alignment**: Researching and building safeguards to ensure the responsible development of robust artificial intelligence systems that promote trust, value alignment, and oversight mechanisms.
