Every Wednesday night in an otherwise-empty basement on the Tufts University campus, a group of students gathers with assorted garbage––buckets, water jugs, trash cans, street signs––to create rhythmic masterpieces. This group is BEATs, Tufts’ oldest and only all-gender street percussion ensemble. I joined in my first semester at Tufts, and by my Sophomore year I had become the **BEATs President**, a.k.a "Prez". This was a 1-year position, and one of my first leadership opportunities at Tufts.

<summary><strong>My Responsibilities</strong></summary>

<ul>
  <li>Coordinating group performances, including time, transportation, availability, and other logistics.</li>
  <li>Maintaining our focus and preparation for performances, including our end-of-semester show. Given that we are also a very social club and members have plenty of other committments, this was sometimes a challenge.</li>
  <li>Managing auditions at the start of the Fall semester, which included mediating the selection process.</li>
  <li>Managing a $2,000+ budget from Tufts alongside our Treasurer and renegotiating the budget for the following year.</li>
</ul>

<summary><strong>BEATs Names</strong></summary>

<p>
When I'm at practice or a show, I am "The Boatman", a name that was granted to me upon my entry into the group. Each member has their own BEATs name that reflects their percussive persona and innermost being.
