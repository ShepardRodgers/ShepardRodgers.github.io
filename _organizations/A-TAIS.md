<summary><strong>About ARENA</strong></summary>

<p>
I am running our Tufts-specific <a href="https://www.arena.education/curriculum">ARENA workshops</a>, which include topics like transformer basics, reinforcement learning, and LLM evals. We are running our first iteration during the Fall '25 semester, and to prepare we have been in contact with leaders from AI Safety organizations across the Boston area. It is also important to have facilitators, including myself, that can guide students through the ARENA material, so we have invested time to learn the curriculum ourselves.
