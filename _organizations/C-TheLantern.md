The Lantern is a student-run, interdisciplinary think tank that investigates the social impact of science and technology to advocate for responsible innovation. As an [STS-focused organization](https://the-lantern.vercel.app/Resources#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20STS%20Department%3F), The Lantern is in line with both my academic and professional interests, and I am currently a **member of the Executive Board**.

<summary><strong>Problems We're Trying to Solve</strong></summary>

<ul>
  <li>The way of thinking in the technical world is not varied enough for the territory that it has entered. We believe that the question of socially responsible innovation demands dialogue across disciplines.</li>
  <li>Academic and expert discussions are not accessible to the general public. We believe that information should be distributed in a way that is easy to understand for the people who are affected by the decisions.</li>
</ul>

<summary><strong>Our Goals</strong></summary>

<ul>
  <li>To break down critical and complex ideas at the intersection of STS for the general public</li>
  <li>To engage students and organizations in a socially responsible path of science and technology</li>
</ul>

<summary><strong>The Magazine</strong></summary>

<p>
One of the primary objectives of The Lantern is to design and publish a magazine each academic year, with written submissions centering around STS topics from the Tufts student body. I have had the privelege of contributing to this magazine, and it is a valuable resource that connects student perspectives on technological impact across different disciplines. <a href="/files/TheLanternMagazineSpring24.pdf/">View the Spring 2024 issue here.</a>
